This afternoon I passed my Professional Scrum Practitioners exam as part of my preparation for an advanced Scrum Master course I'm attending next month.
The exam was quite a bit harder than the PSM I, PSPO I and PSD I exams.
The questions are longer, require more precise reading and require better judgment; answers are less clear-cut and passing the exam requires more than reading the Scrum Guide and practicing some open assessments.
This made taking the exam a more challenging and more pleasant experience. 

> Scrum mastery is a journey, not a destination. After PSM I, Professional Scrum Practitioner (PSP) is a new intermediate-level assessment that enables you to demonstrate that you know Scrum AND that you can apply your knowledge and experience in complex real-world situations. 

The [ PSP assessment ][PSP] is not actively promoted and I'm the 75th person on the [certification list]. The kind of badge we would appreciate on Stack Overflow :)

I answered two facilitation / coaching questions incorrectly - good thing I'm taking a course next month ...
