title: Using interactive causal loop diagrams

{% include JB/setup %}

In a short series of posts I'll try to illustrate
system dynamics in the software development process
using interactive [causal loop diagrams].
Below is an example of a simple causal loop diagram,
relating a team's happiness to the value it delivers and the impact it has.

I found it incredibly insightful 
to use causal loop diagrams with my software teams 
to visualize how different aspects of our process interact.
We usually do this together on a big whiteboard. 
Without exception this tool has generated valuable discussion and insight. 

The diagrams in this series are created using [loopy].
With loopy, the static models from the whiteboard come to life,
which allows for quick simulation and experimentation.
What always stuns me is the timing of our actions -
often the effects of our actions are only observed later,
by which time our system is raging out of control.
This becomes obvious by playing with the loopy models.
