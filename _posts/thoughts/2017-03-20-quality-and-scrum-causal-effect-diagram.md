Here is a possible cause-effect diagram
of the relations between pressuring the team,
collaboratively working on 
a shared understanding of the required quality levels
and the speed of delivery.

Use the up and down arrows in the nodes in the model to:

 * put some pressure on the team to deliver faster
 * work a little less on our shared understanding of quality and Done software
 * have the team cut some corners

What happens to the speed of delivery? When do you see changes? 
Do you like all the changes you see?
