{% include JB/setup %}

Here is a causal loop diagram on long release cycles, 
taken form "Lean from the Trenches" 
[[Kniberg, 2011]].

Use the up and down arrows in the nodes in the model to:

 * Make a release slightly bigger;
 * Reduce the manual work required;
 * Release a bit more often.

What happens to Delayed Revenue? What changes do you see? 
Do you like all the changes you see?
Can you think of any structural changes 
you can put to use to change the dynamics of this model?
