On LinkedIn a [big a network is important][500 connections].
Your network is a reflection of your personal brand.
How to grow your network in a way that it reflects your personal brand?

This is my plan.
Feel free to use it as a template for yours.

#### My personal brand

I'm an 
honest, transparent, confronting, caring, 
capable, learning, and knowledgeable grower of agile software teams.
Life is short, so:
 * grow high quality software,
 * grow high quality teams,
 * grow high quality relations.

I'd like my network to reflect this.

#### Experiment

There are many reasons [why big network helps][500 connections].
One goal can be to reach a larger audience.
Let's run the following experiment:

When I grow my LinkedIn network to 500+ connections,
my next availability update in late September
will reach 1000 views.

At the time of writing, my network has 357 connections.
My [August status update] got 538 views.
I should be able to grow my network to 500 connections in two weeks.
Then I'll post a similar status update and see how many views it receives in two weeks.

#### How?!?

There are many articles online that give 
[tips to get to 500] and describe [how to get to 500].
I will not repeat those here.

I want to get to 500 AND build a quality network.

These are my principals for building a quality network:

 * The best connections are those where 
   there is mutual benefit in building a relationship,
   [connections are two-way].
 * Be kind, genuine and sincere.
 * Aim for the long run, not the short-term win.

<!--
It is doable to get to 500. Make them count. Some numbers:

 * there are 17 authors of the manifesto for agile software development
 * there are 483 PSM III certified Scrum Masters
 * there are xxx Scrum Trainers
 * there are 72 Agility Scales members
 * there 457 contacts on my phone
 * agile mentoring
 * agile and lean
 * my basketball club has about 300+ basketball players and another 200+ volunteers
-->

#### Action!

These are the actions I will take:

 * Update my profile
 * Find people to connect to, first I will look in the agile community
 * Join some more groups
 * Do some networking on LinkedIn everyday
 * Personalize my connection requests

What will you do? 

You could start by sending me
[a personalized connection request on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marijnvanderzee)!
