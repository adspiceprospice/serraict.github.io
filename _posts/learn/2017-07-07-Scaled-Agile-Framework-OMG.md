I started studying [Scaled Agile Framework][SAFe].
I'm trying (really hard) to keep an open mind.
My first reaction when reading about this framework was ... 
"What is this?!? This can not be right! This is WRONG! Poor people!".
Well that probably tells you a lot about me personally
and very little about SAFe - of which I know _very_ little.

So, I did a morning read-up on SAFe; 
first finding confirmation of my personal biases 
from [[Ken Schwaber]], [[Ron Jeffries]] 
and this article with some fairly sound [[SAFe criticism]].
Then I read an InfoQ article by [Lyssa Adkins on SAFe]
pointing out some good stuff. I watched this video on Youtube by 
[Lars Roost and Henrik Kniberg].

Then I decided to at least study SAFe a bit. 
I'm giving myself 4 morning slots of 3 hours to study the 500+ page
[SAFe 4.0 Reference Guide] and three one-hour sessions 
to write about what I've learned.

Note: 
For me this is an exercise in learning about something 
that (initially) sends shivers down my spine. 
I tried studying Prince2 (I started two times) and failed early.

<!--
SAFe is good. It's just not good enough. It provides some benefit, but endangers an organization's progress toward really high functioning. As someone who has been in the Agile movement since before it started, I do not like it. It's fast food. You can do better.
