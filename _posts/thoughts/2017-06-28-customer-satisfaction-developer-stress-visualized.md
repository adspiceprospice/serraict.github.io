title: Customer satisfaction and developer stress visualized

{% include JB/setup %}

Here is a causal loop diagram showing a model relating
customer satisfaction to developer stress.
It is taken (and slightly modified) from "How Software is Built"
[[Weinberg, 2014]].

Use the up and down arrows in the nodes in the model to:

 * Decrease customer satisfaction a bit;
 * Make the developer stress level a lot lower;
 * Increase quality reality.

What happens when we make the schedule match reality a bit more?
Why not add a little pressure on the developers?

What can you do as a manager to make this a more healthy system?
Any structural changes? Could adapting to Scrum help?
